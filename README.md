# Landing Page Project

This is the second project for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree program. It utilizes a starter code, provided by Udacity.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Description

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate knowledge of Javascript to create a NavBar which scrolls to the selected section when clicked, and highlights the section accordingly.
